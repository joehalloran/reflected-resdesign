          <h2 class="page-header">About ReflectED</h2>
            <p><strong>ReflectED</strong> is an approach to learning that teaches and develops children’s metacognition skills (learning how they learn). It supports and improves attainment, especially amongst lower achieving pupils.</p>
            <p>The project will test the impact of a programme to teach children meta-cognition skills. These skills are concerned with pupils’ ability to think about their learning explicitly: to assess their progress, set and monitor goals, and identify strengths and challenges in their learning.</p>
            <p>Rosendale Primary School has developed an approach where children are taught the skills of reflection and then record their learning moments and strategies through photographs, written records and audio recordings on a digital platform called ‘Evernote’. They ‘tag’ their learning with reflections so that they can refer back to help them in their learning journey. Teachers can also look across these tags to get an overview of the areas that pupils are enjoying or struggling with, and identify specific pupil needs.</p>
            <p>ReflectED aims to help learners of all backgrounds develop the tools to make excellent progress in their learning and fulfil their potential.</p>
            <p>Twenty-four schools will be recruited, with year 5 classes randomly allocated to treatment or control for one year. This will enable us to test the effect of the teacher-pupil intervention against a within-school control group, providing the best comparison and statistical power. This will tell us how well the project improves outcomes for learners. After taking part in the one year trial, schools can then roll out the approach to the control teachers in year 5 and to year groups lower down the school. Pupil outcomes will be measured in respect of impact on literacy, numeracy and attitudes to learning. The intervention will be evaluated by a team from Manchester University.</p>
            <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p>
            <ol>
            <li>Pupils receive a weekly ReflectED (metacognition) lesson from trained teachers – following a series of expertly designed lesson plans.</li>
            <li>Throughout the week, pupils have a chance to reflect on their learning and record those reflections on the &#8216;Evernote&#8217; platform (accessible through any tablet, netbook, laptop or PC).</li>
            <li>Children ‘tag’ their reflections – this enables them, and the teacher, to go back to reflections to inform future teaching and learning.</li>
            <li>Evidence suggests the meta-cognitive skills children develop will significantly enhance their learning.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>What resources will be required and what support will be provided?</strong></p>
            <ol>
            <li>Participating school leaders need to commit to the year long programme and its principles.</li>
            <li>One year 5 teacher (or more if more than one teacher covers the class), randomly selected in a two form entry school, commits to the training and the delivery of the programme.</li>
            <li>The training programme includes a launch, three ‘in school’ sessions and a day at Rosendale Primary School during the 2014/15 academic year. The programme finishes with a conference in summer 2015.</li>
            <li>The project is fully funded – all materials, teacher cover costs (when attending the Continuous Profressional Development (CPD)) and travel are included.</li>
            <li>The school commits to providing pre- and post-project data for effective evaluation.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Technical support, materials, films, audio and a dedicated website will be provided in addition to the CPD and the benefits of working in a local network of schools.</p>
            <p><strong>Are there any restrictions?</strong></p>
            <ol>
            <li>Participating schools must have at least two forms of entry.</li>
            <li>Schools must have a effective wireless network.</li>
            <li>Schools must have a minimum 10% of children eligible for the Pupil Premium.</li>
            <li>Schools must not &#8216;set&#8217; pupils in year 5 (or be prepared not to set year 5 pupils for the duration of their involvement in the project).</li>
            <li>Schools must be fully committed to all aspects of the project for the duration.</li>
            </ol>
            <p><strong>What happens at the end of the programme?</strong></p>
            <p>Participating schools will be able to use the materials in other year 5 classes. The ReflectED project will be rolled out to more schools across all year groups should it prove to have sufficient impact on learners.</p>
